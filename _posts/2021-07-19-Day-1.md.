# Day 1: Wednesday, July 14 2021
The first sessions of the day began with **Breakouts A**. Of these, I decided to attend the *Being a Reflective CS Teacher* led by Dan Blier.  After finishing my 3rd year as a high school teacher, I am looking forward to taking stock of what I feel I've done well and where I can improve my teaching practice.  This session seemed like a great place to start that journey.
